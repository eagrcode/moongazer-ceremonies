            If you want to celebrate your new arrival with your family and friends, this is the
            perfect non-religious way to welcome a new member into your family. It might be to
            welcome a baby into the world or a newly adopted child into your family. We will work
            together to create a unique ceremony which may include readings and symbolic gestures.
            You can include godparents, guide parents or guardians who will promise to love and
            support your child during the ceremony.
